1. [Constitution Search App](./ConstitutionSearchApp.R)
  contains code for a shiny app I developed that allows a user to search the text of 97 tribal constitutions from *Measuring institutional variation across American Indian constitutions using automated content analysis* (2020). This tool allows for quick coding of a variety of tribal constitutional institutions including voting age, residency requirements, and blood quantum. However, there are many tribal constitutions now available online that are not included in this dataset.
